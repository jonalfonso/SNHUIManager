# SNHUIManager

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
You need to be registered user of the SNHU Inventory Manager to login. If you do not have one please create one to log into the system. Once you are logged you will be able to access
the inventory system. From here you will be able to add, delete, or modify product into your inventory. Please grant access for notifications. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? 
A login screen is required to log into the system.
An inventory screen was created to add items into inventory.
A data table was created to store the information.

How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
I feel that the designs are simple and easy to use for any user. The colors are not bright so it is also easy on the eyes in different environments.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I kept time open as much as I could. I wanted to have an information architecture to figure out how I even wanted to approach this. Wireframes and nice 
workflow from screen to screen. These strategies will be applied to every project from now on. I left 9/22 to move from NH to NV and found out the house was 
not ready to move in on 10/1. I have been stuck in a hotel since then. It has been a nightmare trying to balance time right now. For future endeavors, I will be sure to be in a better environment where I am not as stressed.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I kept running tests, after tests to make sure I was not messing anything up by editing other files. I had to make sure everything was written clear, 
so I am able to go back and see where I messed up.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I originally had so many ideas I wanted to execute but I was looking at a full fledged application. I was shooting too high so I derailed and kept it simple.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I feel that when I created the ability to add stock into a database was the best way to show my skills. It was really hard to do but I was happy with the results.
